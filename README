danbo - layered sandbox tool

danbo sets up an aufs chroot in an isolated PID and mount namespace.
Changes are stored in an isolated directory on top of a base system, and
new layers can be recursively created on top of current ones.  In this
way, changes can be made experimentally and discarded, merged, or
composed with other layers.

You will need:

- A kernel with aufs support (recent Debian/Ubuntu kernels seem to have
  it automatically).
- A kernel with CLONE_NEWNS and CLONE_NEWPID support (2.6.24 or later)
- If you want to use the --restricted option, kernel support for cgroups
  and prctl(PR_CAPBSET_DROP, ...), with each individual cgroup
  controllers mounted on /sys/fs/cgroup/<controller> (2.6.25 or later).
  Cgroups are set up like this automatically by Ubuntu's cgroup-lite
  package.

By default, `make install` will install only danbo and a skeletal base
filesystem structure in /var/lib/danbo.  To actually use danbo, you will
also need something to run inside /var/lib/danbo/base.  Danbo includes
configuration to build and install a static busybox binary with `make
busybox-root` and `make install-busybox-root`.  Note that this will
download busybox via `wget`.

To start a danbo session, just run /var/lib/danbo/base/sbin/danbo, as
root.  Danbo is suid root so that you can enter a layer as a normal
user, but /var/lib/danbo is by default only accessible to root.
